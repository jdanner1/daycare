### week 10
Brainstormed on what we wanted our web service to provide and how to comsume it. Started 
making the interface and setting up the code to consume our web service. Implemented Hibernate.

### Week 11
Cleaned up Hibernate in our indie project to started creating Web service. Hibernate was a small 
set back trying to handle a many to many relationship. Created the web service and received data back in plain text
with no issues. When trying to convert our java object into json we ran into another set back. It kept giving us 
a Lazy Initialization Exception error. Researching and moving past this error consumed the rest of the week.

### Week 12
Started off by still researching the conversion to json. Found our crutch with an @JSONIgnore annotation to 
ignore our hibernate constraint. Data is now coming back. Formatted output. Created User Guide and unit testing.
Populated the database with more applicable data for users. Things are going smoothly at this point.

### Week 13
All final updates and changes for the presentation and completetion of team project ---GO TEAM TACOS

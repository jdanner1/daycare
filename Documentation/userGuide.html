                    JSON or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight text‐based open standard designed for
                    human‐readable data interchange. It is derived from the JavaScript scripting language for
                    representing simple data structures and associative arrays, called objects.

                <td>

                    When the request is made a structure with an ID, First Name and Last Name of a student will return the details
                    of the contacts linked to that student. The HTTP response will contain a valid status (200  “ok”)

        <p>
            Once the user logs into the service:

            *(each user should be given log in credentials from the daycare for employment)*

            A form allows the user to access all services from a single GUI.

            This service extracts all the students, finds the particular student you entered,
            grabs each of his/her contacts and outputs their information in a table format to the webpage.

            The application will be accessible only to employees through a standard web browser simply
            by accessing one of the URL's given through employment at Kiddie Kollege Daycare.
